## Greetings, stranger!

My name is Abdallah. I'm a junior software engineer with experience since July 2021, mostly proficient as a full-stack web developer. I have been working in several places, with many projects done successfully. I'm used to using the LAMP stack with Laravel (TALL stack) as the backend and version control such as Github and Gitlab.

Over the years, I've worked in teams, both as the team leader and member; as well as working individually by myself. Iâ€™m highly adaptive and always push myself to learn new things in order to bring the best result for my projects, or simply to fulfill my sense of curiosity. I'm currently learning Docker Compose to better tailor my dev environment, and to build Laravel using the VILT stack.

If necessary, you can reach me from [email](mailto:mrifqyabdallah@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrifqyabdallah). Have a good day!
